# Reason Sorting Algorithms

**Check out my other repository, [reason-data-structures](https://github.com/JakeDawkins/reason-data-structures) with some... data structures in reason 💯**

Hey! This is just a project I'm working on showcasing some basic sorting algorithms in Reason.

Right now, all that is here is a first try at quicksort. Feel free to play around with whatever you want though 👍. Hit me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jakedawkins) if you'd like.

**Side Note**: I built this using bucklescript and `bs-platform` because I can't get the reason cli installed on my computer at the moment (path too long. thanks nvm).
