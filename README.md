# Reason Data Structures

Hey! This is just a project I'm working on showcasing me building some basic data structures/algorithms in Reason.

Right now, I only have an incomplete BST implementation (only supports insert/print) and my first attempt at quicksort. Feel free to play around with whatever you want though üëç. Hit me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jakedawkins) if you'd like.

**Side Note**: I built this using bucklescript and `bs-platform` because I can't get the reason cli installed on my computer at the moment (path too long. thanks nvm).
